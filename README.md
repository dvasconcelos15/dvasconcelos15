- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dvasconcelos15
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games, programming, movies and soccer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Web triforce :D HTML, CSS and Javascript. Soon i'll start the frameworks and intend to get some PHP skills.<br>
I'm also working on a personal project, that was born in a first place as an activity to practice, but i validated it and it seems to have some business potencial.
- ðŸ“« I can be found via email and linkedin: dvasconcelos15@gmail.com
